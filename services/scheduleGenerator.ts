// This file is now obsolete.
// The complex scheduling logic has been moved to a dedicated Python CP-SAT solver service,
// as per the architectural specification. The frontend now orchestrates calls to this service
// via Vercel API routes and no longer performs any scheduling calculations itself.
// The transformation of solver results (`schedule_slots`) into the UI's `DailySchedule` format
// is now handled within the `useStudyPlanManager` hook.
